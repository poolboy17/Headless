      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Ghosts and Toasts: Haunted Non-Alcoholic Pub Crawl is a 2-hour walking tour in Savannah that combines the city's legendary ghost stories with visits to historic pubs, offering a family-friendly paranormal experience through America's most haunted city.</p>

      <p>As twilight descends over Savannah's cobblestone streets, the city transforms. Gas lamps flicker to life along the moss-draped squares, and shadows seem to move just beyond the corner of your eye. Visitors report feeling sudden cold spots near the old colonial buildings, and our research into Savannah's paranormal activity confirms what locals have known for centuries—this city never truly lets go of its dead.</p>

      <p>The Ghosts and Toasts tour takes you through the heart of Savannah's Historic District, where centuries of tragedy, plague, and violence have left an indelible spiritual imprint. From the infamous Marshall House—still operating as a hotel despite its history as a Civil War hospital—to the haunted taverns where spectral patrons are said to still order drinks, every stop on this tour has a story that will raise the hair on the back of your neck.</p>

      <h2>The Haunted History of Savannah</h2>

      <p>Founded in 1733 by General James Oglethorpe, Savannah has accumulated nearly three centuries of tragedy. The city survived multiple yellow fever epidemics—the 1820 outbreak alone claimed over 700 lives, with bodies stacked in the streets faster than they could be buried. According to historical records from the Georgia Historical Society, many victims were interred in mass graves beneath what are now busy intersections and public squares.</p>

      <p>The Civil War transformed Savannah into a city of the wounded and dying. The Marshall House Hotel served as a Union hospital where surgeons performed amputations around the clock. During renovations in 1999, workers discovered human bones and surgical implements beneath the floorboards—remnants of the limbs discarded during those desperate wartime operations.</p>

      <p>Lesser known is Savannah's role in the colonial slave trade. The city's wealth was built on human suffering, and paranormal investigators have documented unexplained phenomena at sites connected to this dark chapter. The Sorrel-Weed House, which you'll pass on this tour, has been featured on Ghost Hunters and is considered one of the most actively haunted locations in North America.</p>

      <h2>What to Expect on the Ghosts and Toasts Tour</h2>

      <p>What happens on this tour goes beyond typical ghost storytelling. Your guide—trained in both Savannah history and paranormal investigation techniques—leads you through dimly lit streets while sharing documented encounters and historical evidence of supernatural activity.</p>

      <h3>Tour Highlights</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Visit 4-5 historic pubs with documented paranormal activity</li>
        <li>Hear first-hand accounts from bar staff about ghostly encounters</li>
        <li>Learn EMF detection techniques used by professional investigators</li>
        <li>Explore Savannah's most haunted squares after dark</li>
        <li>Receive non-alcoholic beverages at select stops (family-friendly)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Is the tour scary? The atmosphere is certainly eerie, but the experience focuses more on historical storytelling than jump scares. Guests frequently report feeling "watched" or experiencing unexplained cold spots, particularly near the Moon River Brewing Company—widely considered Savannah's most haunted building.</p>

      <h2>Who Is This Savannah Ghost Tour Best For?</h2>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> History enthusiasts, paranormal curious visitors, families with older children (10+), couples seeking unique date nights, and anyone who wants to experience Savannah beyond the typical tourist trail.</p>

      <p><strong>Great choice if you:</strong> Prefer walking tours over bus tours, enjoy storytelling and local legends, want to visit historic pubs without alcohol pressure, or are fascinated by the intersection of documented history and unexplained phenomena.</p>

      <p><strong>Consider alternatives if:</strong> You have mobility limitations (tour covers 1+ miles on foot), prefer daytime activities, or are looking for a pub crawl focused on drinking rather than history.</p>
