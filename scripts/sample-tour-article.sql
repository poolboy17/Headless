<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ghosts and Toasts: Haunted Non-Alcoholic Pub Crawl is a 2-hour walking tour in Savannah that combines the city''s legendary ghost stories with visits to historic pubs, offering a family-friendly paranormal experience through America''s most haunted city.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As twilight descends over Savannah''s cobblestone streets, the city transforms. Gas lamps flicker to life along the moss-draped squares, and shadows seem to move just beyond the corner of your eye. Visitors report feeling sudden cold spots near the old colonial buildings, and our research into Savannah''s paranormal activity confirms what locals have known for centuries—this city never truly lets go of its dead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Ghosts and Toasts tour takes you through the heart of Savannah''s Historic District, where centuries of tragedy, plague, and violence have left an indelible spiritual imprint. From the infamous Marshall House—still operating as a hotel despite its history as a Civil War hospital—to the haunted taverns where spectral patrons are said to still order drinks, every stop on this tour has a story that will raise the hair on the back of your neck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
<h2>The Haunted History of Savannah</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Founded in 1733 by General James Oglethorpe, Savannah has accumulated nearly three centuries of tragedy. The city survived multiple yellow fever epidemics—the 1820 outbreak alone claimed over 700 lives, with bodies stacked in the streets faster than they could be buried. According to historical records from the Georgia Historical Society, many victims were interred in mass graves beneath what are now busy intersections and public squares.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Civil War transformed Savannah into a city of the wounded and dying. The Marshall House Hotel served as a Union hospital where surgeons performed amputations around the clock. During renovations in 1999, workers discovered human bones and surgical implements beneath the floorboards—remnants of the limbs discarded during those desperate wartime operations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lesser known is Savannah''s role in the colonial slave trade. The city''s wealth was built on human suffering, and paranormal investigators have documented unexplained phenomena at sites connected to this dark chapter. The Sorrel-Weed House, which you''ll pass on this tour, has been featured on Ghost Hunters and is considered one of the most actively haunted locations in North America.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
